# CurrentSensor
## Schedule
1. Planning and buy material (05/05)
2. Breadboard Prototype (05/10)
3. Prototype with ACS712 (05/11)
4. Prototype with resistor (05/12)
4. Welding Prototype (05/14)

## Material
1. UNO
2. ACS712
3. bread board
4. jumper wire

## Calibration Process
This process will modify Vref and sensitivity.
1. While the motor is disconnected, the output should be zero. So, modify the Vref so the output can be zero.
2. Serial a current meter, modify sensitivity to make output equal to current meter.
